# Assignment 0 Template
Template and instructions for creating your own Assignment0

## Instructions

Please follow these instructions very carefully.

1. Use the green `Template` button above to create your own github repository
2. Name it `Assignment0` when you create your own github repository from this template
3. Clone this down to your local box _**inside your coders campus workspace directory**_ being very careful to place it exactly there!
4. Rename this README.md file to your proper name, such as `John Smith` if that was your name
5. Commit and push it back up.

## Tips

- Here's what it looks like to clone it straight from Github Desktop right in github.com

- Using github desktop is super dangerous if you don't pay attention to the folder that it clones your local repository into.

## Should I repeat Assignment0?

Whatever it takes to make this process easy ... one option is to keep going back and repeating this process.

- Assignment0b
- Assignment0c
- Assignment0d
- Assignment0e

You can repeat this as many times as you wish, you'll just have to delete the repositories from your github when they start feeling like clutter.
